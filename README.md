# Admini

> Minimalistic Admin Panel built with Bootstrap 5

## Features

- No bloat, only what's strictly required to get a decent admin panel
- A nice, modern, Bootstrap 5 based interface
- A friendly dashboard
- A powerful action system that supports many use cases (multiple actions, drops, navigation, offcanvas panel...)
- Smart tabs that are fully responsive *based on their content* and that can deep link specific parts of the UI
- A sane default layout for forms (includes tabbed form support and responsive by default)
- Toast notifications
- A nice default set of colors that are more accessible
- Carefully selected form components (cleave, flatpickr, bootstrap 5 tags, superfile)

## Icons

### The build setup

Admini use esbuild to compile the js assets. After cloning this repo, simply run

```
npm start
```

And you will get a fully functional local demo to play with.

If you want to work on the css, run in another terminal the following

```
npm run watch-css
```

And your css will be compiled automatically.

No complicated build pipe :-)
